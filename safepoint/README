# Instructions to run safepoint experiments (Figure 6)

## Build gem5 and benchmark programs
First switch to the `safepoint` branch and pull the required submodules.

```
git checkout safepoint
git submodule update --init -- aspen-gem5
```

Compile gem5 using `scons`:

```
scons build/X86/gem5.fast -j 24
```

Run the following scripts to create the necessary image for experiments:

```
./one_time_setup_safepoint.sh
./make_disk_safepoint.sh
```

## Run experiments

Run the experiment script. The results will be stored in the `result/safepoint` directory:

```
./run_safepoint.sh
```

The generated figure will be saved as `result/safepoint/figure6.pdf`
